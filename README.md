# Tech Challenge - FIAP - Software Architecture
## Current phase: Phase 1

Self-service system developed for an expanding snack bar, aimed at solving issues of confusion and delays in orders.



In the first phase, the following functionalities were developed for the API:

* Customer Registration
* Customer Identification via CPF
* Create, Edit, and Remove Products
* Search Products by Category
* Fake Checkout, just send the selected products to the queue. The checkout is the order completion.
* List Orders

## To run the code using docker(recommended):

First you need to install  ```docker``` and ```docker compose```.

Run:
```
docker compose up
```
